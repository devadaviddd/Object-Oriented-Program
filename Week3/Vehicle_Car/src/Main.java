        *  Start with a base class of Vehicle, then create a Car class that inherits from this base class.
        *  Finally, create another class, a specific type of Car that inherits from the Car class.
        *  You should be able to hand steering, changing gears, and moving (speed in other ways).
        *  You will want to decide where to put the appropriate state and behaviours (fields and methods).
        *  As mentioned above, changing gear, increasing/ decreasing speed should be included.
        *  For you specific type of vehicle you will want to add something specific for that type of car*/
